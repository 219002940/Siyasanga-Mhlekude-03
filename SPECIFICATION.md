## Project Title: Smart Healthcare Monitoring System

### Domain
**Healthcare** â€“ This system is designed for hospitals and healthcare institutions to monitor patients' vital signs in real time, ensuring rapid intervention during critical situations.

### Problem Statement
Hospitals require a reliable and real-time monitoring system to track patient health conditions continuously. The lack of automated monitoring increases response time, potentially leading to critical delays in treatment. This project aims to develop a smart monitoring system using IoT and AI for predictive alerts.

### Individual Scope
The project will be feasible as it utilizes widely available IoT devices and cloud-based processing. Python-based backend services will manage data flow and AI-driven alert systems. The system will be scalable for integration with existing hospital management systems.
