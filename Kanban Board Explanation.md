Kanban Board Explanation  

What is a Kanban Board?  
A **Kanban board** is a visual tool used in Agile project management to track work progress and optimize workflow efficiency. It consists of columns representing different stages of a task's lifecycle, helping teams manage workloads effectively.

How Our Kanban Board Works  

1. **Visualizing Workflow**  
- The board consists of multiple columns, each representing a **stage in task progress**:  
  - **Backlog** → Tasks that need prioritization.  
  - **To Do** → Tasks selected for the sprint.  
  - **Development** → Tasks actively being worked on.  
  - **Testing** → Tasks undergoing quality assurance.  
  - **Blocked** → Tasks that cannot progress due to issues.  
  - **Done** → Completed and deployed tasks.  
- **Automation Rules** help move tasks between columns as they progress.

 2. Limiting Work-In-Progress (WIP) 
- To prevent **bottlenecks**, the board limits the number of tasks in key columns:  
  - **Development:** Max 3 tasks per developer.  
  - **Testing:** Only 5 tasks at a time to maintain QA focus.  
- **Blocked Column:** Flags dependencies or unresolved issues to prevent overloading developers.  

3.Supporting Agile Principles 
- Continuous Delivery:** The board enables real-time tracking of features, ensuring a steady workflow for releases.  
- Adaptability:Tasks can be reprioritized based on stakeholder feedback or emerging issues.  
- Collaboration: Developers, testers, and product managers can easily see task progress and dependencies.  
- Efficiency: Automation reduces manual tracking, allowing teams to focus on coding and testing.
