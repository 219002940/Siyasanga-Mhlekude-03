## Project Title: Smart Healthcare Monitoring System

### Description
A real-time patient monitoring system designed for hospitals and healthcare facilities. This system will collect, process, and display vital signs and patient data, alerting medical staff when intervention is needed. It aims to improve patient care efficiency and reduce response time in emergency situations.

# Smart Healthcare Monitoring System – Kanban Board Customization

##  Overview  
This project uses an **Automated Kanban** board in GitHub Projects to track Agile development tasks for the **Smart Healthcare Monitoring System**. The board has been customized to align with the system’s workflow, quality assurance (QA) requirements, and sprint planning.

---

#Customization Choices  

###1. **Added ‘Testing’ Column**  
**Reason:** Ensures that all completed tasks undergo thorough **Quality Assurance (QA)** before deployment.  
**Impact:**  
- Enhances system reliability by enforcing testing before marking tasks as "Done".  
- QA engineers can verify issues before merging them into the final product.

### 2. **Renamed ‘In Progress’ to ‘Development’**  
**Reason:** To clearly differentiate active coding tasks from non-coding work.  
**Impact:**  
- Avoids confusion between ongoing development and non-technical work like documentation.  

### 3. **Created ‘Blocked’ Column**  
**Reason:** Provides visibility into tasks that cannot progress due to dependencies or issues.  
**Impact:**  
- Helps identify roadblocks early, ensuring smooth sprint execution.  
- Encourages quick resolution of blockers to maintain workflow efficiency.  

### 4. **Automated Issue Movement**  
**Reason:** Reduces manual tracking and enhances Agile workflow.  
**Impact:**  
- Newly created issues automatically move to the **Backlog**.  
- Assigned tasks transition to **Development** when a developer starts working.  
- Issues move to **Testing** when a pull request is opened.  
- Completed tasks shift to **Done** after approval.

## 📋 Kanban Board Structure  

| Column Name     | Purpose & Workflow                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backlog**     | Contains new issues and user stories awaiting prioritization.    |
| **To Do**       | Selected tasks for the current sprint.                           |
| **Development** | Active coding tasks currently in progress.                      |
| **Testing**     | Tasks under QA verification before deployment.                   |
| **Blocked**     | Tasks that cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues.        |
| **Done**        | Completed and approved tasks.                                   |

 Benefits of Customization  
- **Better QA Integration:** Ensures **thorough testing** before deployment.  
- **Increased Transparency:** Highlights blockers and dependencies.  
- **Efficient Workflow:** Reduces manual tracking via **automated movement**.  
- **Improved Sprint Planning:** Organizes tasks based on priority and development progress.

---

Conclusion  
These customizations ensure a structured and **Agile-friendly** workflow, improving task management, quality assurance, and project tracking in the **Smart Healthcare Monitoring System**.
