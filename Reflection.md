## 4. Reflection: Challenges Faced

1. **Balancing Real-Time Monitoring and System Load**
   - Ensuring real-time data processing without overloading servers required careful API rate limiting.

2. **Security vs. Accessibility**
   - Encrypting patient data while allowing authorized personnel seamless access was challenging.

3. **Integration with Existing Hospital Systems**
   - Compatibility with legacy systems required developing flexible APIs.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Ensuring compliance with healthcare standards (e.g., HIPAA) meant rigorous validation and logging.

5. **Stakeholder Needs Conflict**
   - Patients wanted access to their vitals, but hospitals were concerned about data privacy.
