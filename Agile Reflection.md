# Reflection: Challenges in Prioritization, Estimation, and Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs(Assignment 6)

## Introduction
Developing the **Smart Healthcare Monitoring System** as a solo stakeholder presented unique challenges in **prioritization, estimation, and aligning Agile methodology** with evolving needs. Without external stakeholders, I had to navigate internal resistance, shifting expectations, and self-imposed constraints. This reflection explores these difficulties and the strategies used to address them.

## 1. Challenges in Prioritization

### **Balancing Core Functionality vs. Additional Features**
One of the biggest struggles was determining which features were **“Must-have”** versus **“Should-have”** or **“Could-have.”** Initially, everything seemed important—real-time vitals, alert systems, security, compliance, role-based access, and integrations. However, implementing all at once was unrealistic.

**Internal Conflict:**
- Should I prioritize **real-time vitals monitoring** or **role-based access first**?
- Security is critical, but does **compliance reporting** need to be in the first release?

**Resolution:**
I used **MoSCoW prioritization** and mapped features against immediate **MVP needs.** If a feature didn’t contribute directly to **patient monitoring, alerts, or security**, it was **postponed to later sprints.** This structured approach reduced overwhelm and made development manageable.

## 2. Challenges in Estimation

### **Overestimating vs. Underestimating Effort**
Estimating development time without external feedback was another major hurdle. Some tasks, like **encrypting patient data**, took longer due to unforeseen complexities, while others, like **building the dashboard UI**, were faster than expected.

**Internal Conflict:**
- How do I determine effort without a team to validate estimates?
- Am I overestimating security concerns at the expense of UI/UX?

**Resolution:**
I applied **relative estimation using story points (1-5 scale)** instead of fixed hours. Comparing tasks helped balance complexity—for example, **“real-time vitals streaming” (5 points) vs. “simple patient info retrieval” (2 points).** This method prevented over-committing to unrealistic sprint goals.

## 3. Challenges in Aligning Agile with My Own Stakeholder Needs

### **Shifting Expectations and Scope Creep**
As the only stakeholder, my **own expectations shifted constantly.** Every time I thought the system was well-defined, new ideas surfaced—like **adding AI-driven predictive alerts.** This created scope creep, making Agile iteration difficult.

**Internal Conflict:**
- Am I building an MVP or an overly complex system?
- Do I need all features now, or can they evolve through iterations?

**Resolution:**
I **limited sprints to two-week cycles,** forcing myself to complete core features before adding extras. Additionally, I set a strict **definition of done** for each sprint, ensuring each increment was usable even if future iterations were needed.

## Conclusion
Prioritization, estimation, and aligning Agile to self-imposed expectations proved to be a **mental challenge** as much as a technical one. However, by using **MoSCoW prioritization, story point estimation, and controlled sprints**, I was able to **overcome internal resistance** and develop a structured, sustainable workflow. This experience reinforced the importance of **discipline, self-awareness, and structured decision-making in Agile development.**
