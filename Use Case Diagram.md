# Key Actors & Roles
1. Patient – Provides real-time health data through IoT devices.
2. Doctor/Nurse – Monitors patient vitals, acknowledges alerts, and makes medical decisions.
3. IoT Sensors – Collect patient vitals and send data to the backend.
4. Hospital IT Staff – Ensures system functionality, performs maintenance, and secures data.
5. Hospital Administrator – Manages staff access and oversees compliance.
6. Family Members – Requests patient condition updates with authorized access.
7. Regulatory Bodies – Ensures compliance with healthcare data standards and audits system reports.

# Relationships & Use Case Descriptions
- Generalization: The Doctor/Nurse and Family Member both interact with View Patient Dashboard, but Family Members have limited access.
- Inclusion:
  - Acknowledge Alerts includes View Patient Dashboard since doctors must check data before responding.
  - Generate Compliance Reports includes View Patient History to track medical trends.

# Addressing Stakeholder Concerns
